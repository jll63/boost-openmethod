[abstract]
== Abstract

Boost OpenMethod implements Open Multi-Methods.
Features:

====
* Header-only C++17 library.

* Closely emulates the N2216 standards committee paper, and extend beyond it.

* Fast dispatch, close or equal in performance to native virtual functions.

* Interoperable with other C++ constructs: templates, friends, namespaces, etc.

* Can be used with or without exception handling.

* Can be used with standard RTTI, or interfaced with custom RTTI.

[[distribution]]
== Distribution

OpenMethod is distributed under the http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt[Boost Software License, Version 1.0].

There are three distribution channels:

* OpenMethod is included in official https://www.boost.org/[Boost] releases (starting with Boost 1.75), and therefore available via most package managers.
* The source code is hosted on https://github.com/boostorg/OpenMethod[GitHub].
* For maximum portability, the latest OpenMethod release is also available in single-header format: link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boostorg/OpenMethod/gh-pages/OpenMethod.hpp[OpenMethod.hpp] (direct download link).

== Motivation

Open-methods are similar to virtual functions, but they are not required to be
members of a class. By being simultaneously free _and_ virtual, they provide a
solution to the Expression Problem:

> Given a set of types, and a set of operations on these types, is it possible
to add new operations on the existing types, and new types to the existing
operations, without modifying existing code?

As a bonus, open-methods can take more than one argument into account when
selecting the appropriate function to call. This solves the problem of multiple
dispatch.

Open-methods are part of Lisp, Clojure, Julia, Cecil, Dylan, TADS, and other
languages. Bjarne Stroustrup wanted open-methods in C++ almost from the
beginning. He writes about it in D&E. Circa 2007, with his PhD students Peter
Pirkelbauer and Yuriy Solodkyy, they wrote a series of papers and an
implementation based on the EDG compiler. Their design fit perfectly with othe
parts of the language. They proposed it for adoption in the standard. It did not
happen.

This library implements the proposal, as closely as possible within the C++17
standard.

=== Hello World

Here is a side-by-side implementation of the same program, using virtual
functions (on the left side) and open-methods (on the right side):

[cols="a,a", options="header"]
|===
| virtual function
| open-method

[source,c++]
----
#include <iostream>



struct Animal {
    virtual ~Animal() = default;
    virtual void kick(std::ostream&) const = 0;
};

struct Cat : Animal {
    void kick(std::ostream& os) const override;
};

struct Dog : Animal {
    void kick(std::ostream& os) const override;
};




void Cat::kick(std::ostream& os) const override {
    os << "hiss";
}


void Dog::kick(std::ostream& os) const override {
    os << "bark";
}




int main() {


    Animal&& a = Cat();
    Animal&& b = Dog();

    a.kick(std::cout); // prints "hiss"
    a.kick(std::cout); // prints "bark"

    return 0;
}

}
----
|===

<1> Include the main OpenMethod header.

<2> Include the compiler header, which provides
`boost::openmethod::initialize()`. This is typically needed only in the `main`
translation unit.

<3> `kick` does not appear anywhere in the class definitions.

<4> `kick` is declared outside of the classes. It is a free function. The
`Animal` argument, implicitly passed as `this` to the virtual function, has
become an explicit parameter. Its type is decorated with `virtual_`. It is not
required to be the first parameter. The virtual function's cv-qualifier is now
applied to the virtual parameter. Note that parameter names are not allowed in
`BOOST_OPENMETHOD` - only types.

<5> provides overrides for `Cat` and `Dog`.

<6> Classes need to be registered for the library to recognize the inheritance
relationships.  This can be done incrementally.

<7> builds the dispatch tables.

<8> `kick` is called as a free function. The appropriate override is called,
depending on the dynamic type if the virtual argument.

If we break it down, we see that the same information is present in both, only
it has moved around in the method version:

* The implicit `this` parameter is explicit in the method signature. The virtual
function's cv-qualifier is now applied to the virtual parameter.

* `virtual` has moved to the is replaced by `virtual_<const Animal&>` has become
a `virtual_` decorator

Incidentally, there is no obligation for the `const Animal&` to be the first
method parameter. `virtual_` can appear anywhere, any number of times. At least
one parameter must be  `virtual_`.

At this point, we can neither call the method, nor the virtual function. We need
to provide overrides.

There are a couple of differences between the two though.

* The open-method is not a member of `Animal`. We can add as many methods about
Animals as we please, without chaning the classes.

 * Adding a pure virtual function to a class makes it abstract - it cananot be
 instantiated. It is not the case with open-methods. Whether or not an
 implementation exists cannot be checked by looking at one translation unit at a
 time. Calling a method with a combination of arguments that does not match any
 method override is a run-time error.

=== Next

If a virtual function overrides a non-pure virtual function, it typically calls
the calls the latter as part of its implementation. The equivalent for
open-methods is a call to special function called `next`. It calls the next most
specific override, i.e. what would have been called if the current override did
not exist.

[source,c++]
----
struct Bulldog : Dog {
};

BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(
    kick, (std::ostream& os, const Bulldog& dog), void) {
        next(os, dog); // prints "bark"
        os << " and bite";
}
----

=== Multiple Dispatch

Open-methods can have more than one virtual parameter.

[source,c++]
----
BOOST_OPENMETHOD(
    std::ostream&, encounter, (virtual_<Animal&>, virtual_<Animal&>), void);

// 'encounter' catch-all implementation.
BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(std::ostream& os, encounter, (Animal&, Animal&, void)) {
    os << "ignore";
}

// Add definitions for specific pairs of animals.
BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(std::ostream& os, encounter, (Dog& dog1, Dog& dog2, void)) {
    os << "wag tail";
}

BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(std::ostream& os, encounter, (Dog& dog, Cat& cat, void)) {
    os << "chase";
}

BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(std::ostream& os, encounter, (Cat& cat, Dog& dog, void)) {
    os << "run";
}
----

The appropriate overrider is selected using the same process similar to overload
resolution. If there is no single overrider that is more specialized than all
the others, the return type is used as a tie-breaker, _if_ it is covariant with
the return type of the base method. If there is still no unique overrider, one
of the overriders is chosen arbitrarily.

=== Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance is supported, with the exception of repeated inheritance.

Virtual inheritance is supported, but it incurs calls to `dynamic_cast` to cast
the method's arguments to the types required by the overrider.
