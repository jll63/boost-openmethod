# Overview

Open-methods are similar to virtual functions, but they are not required to be
members of a class. By being simultaneously free _and_ virtual, they provide a
solution to the Expression Problem:

> Given a set of types, and a set of operations on these types, is it possible
to add new operations on the existing types, and new types to the existing
operations, without modifying existing code?

As a bonus, open-methods can take more than one argument into account when
selecting the appropriate function to call. This solves the problem of multiple
dispatch.

Open-methods are part of Lisp, Clojure, Julia, Cecil, Dylan, TADS, and other
languages. Bjarne Stroustrup wanted open-methods in C++ almost from the
beginning. He writes about it in D&E. Circa 2007, with his PhD students Peter
Pirkelbauer and Yuriy Solodkyy, they wrote a series of papers and an
implementation based on the EDG compiler. Their design fit perfectly with othe
parts of the language. They proposed it for adoption in the standard. It did not
happen.

This library implements the proposal, as closely as possible within the C++17
standard.
