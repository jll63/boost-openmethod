### BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_POLICY

The name of the default policy.

`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_POLICY` is the default value for the `Policy` template
parameter of `method`, `use_classes`, and other constructs defined in
`<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>`. If it is not defined,
`::boost::openmethod::policy::default_` is used.

`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_POLICY` can be defined by a program to change the
default policy globally. Once `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>` has been included,
redefining the symbol has no effect. The proper sequence is as follows:

1. Include headers under `boost/openmethod/policies/` as needed.
2. Create a policy class, and set `BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_POLICY`.
3. Include `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>`.
